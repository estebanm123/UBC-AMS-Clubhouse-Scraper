# UBC-AMS-Clubhouse-Scraper

Scrapes detailed information for every UBC club at https://www.campusvibe.ca/campusvibe/campus/cea260f5-8aab-4e11-bccf-fe4a846e62dc and puts it all in a JSON file. Works by simulating user scroll-down and intercepting incoming ajax responses. 

Requires node.js and puppeteer package to work. 

Commented out underneath is my initial attempt solely scraping DOM elements after render.
